Taisei Hanyu is a lab assistant at the AICV Lab. I'm currently working toward the honors B.S. degree in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. My current research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and 3D computer vision. In particular, I am fascinated by the integration of vision-language models to enhance the ability of autonomous systems to perceive and interact effectively with unstructured environments.
